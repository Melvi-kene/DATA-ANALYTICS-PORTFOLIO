**Insights:**  
- Main dishes generate the highest revenue (pasta alfredo & grilled chicken lead)  
- Loyal customers like `CUST_089` drive repeat sales  
- Peak sales in **Oct 2022** and **May 2023** show seasonal opportunities  
- Cash & credit cards dominate payments, while digital wallet adoption is low  

**Recommendations:**  
- Launch festive & seasonal campaigns (especially in December & February)  
- Create a loyalty/referral program to boost retention  
- Introduce new variations of best-selling dishes  
- Encourage digital wallet use with discounts or rewards
