### 1. CafeNova Data Analysis (Excel Dashboard)
## Project Objective
CafeNova is a fast-growing casual dining chain offering a wide range of meals and beverages across multiple outlets. While sales have grown steadily, the management team was unsure of what items, categories, and customer segments were driving the most value or where they were losing money.

I was tasked to **clean, analyze, and deliver insights** using historical sales data. The goal was to uncover what‚Äôs working, what‚Äôs not, and make clear recommendations ‚Äî all presented in a professional **interactive dashboard**.

## Dataset Used
[CafeNova Dataset](https://github.com/Melvi-kene/CAFENOVA-DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/main/CAFENOVA_EKENE_OZ0BIALU_DASHBOARD.xlsx)

## Key Questions (KPIs)
- Total Revenue  
- Best Selling Category  
- Best Selling Item  
- Number of Unique Customers  
- Monthly Sales Trend  
- Year with Highest Sales & Orders  
- Most Used Payment Method  
- Top 4 Customers  
- Interactive Dashboard [View Dashboard Screenshot](https://github.com/Melvi-kene/CAFENOVA-DATA-ANALYSIS/blob/main/scrnli_RDoF6e6f3FZki6.png)

## Process
1. Verified data for missing values and anomalies, then cleaned accordingly.  
2. Ensured data consistency in type, format, and values.  
3. Created pivot tables to answer the KPIs.  
4. Merged all pivot tables into a single interactive dashboard using **slicers** for dynamic analysis.

## Project Insights

### Performance Highlights
- Main dishes generate the most revenue, led by **Pasta Alfredo** and **Grilled Chicken**.  
- Loyal customers, like `CUST_089`, contribute significantly to repeat orders.  
- Peak sales in **October 2022** and **May 2023** indicate seasonal opportunities.  
- **Cash** and **credit cards** are the most preferred payment methods.

### Performance Gaps
- Total sales declined in 2023 compared to 2022.  
- **February** recorded the lowest sales in both years.  
- **December** underperformed despite being a holiday month.  
- Digital wallet usage remains low compared to other payment options.


## Strategic Recommendations
- Launch festive campaigns and targeted promotions in **December** and **February**.  
- Implement a loyalty or referral program to retain customers and attract new ones.  
- Introduce new variations of best-selling main dishes.  
- Consider bundling items (e.g., main + starter) to increase order value.  
- Encourage digital wallet use through small discounts or reward incentives.  
- Investigate causes of 2023 sales drop via customer feedback or external factors.  
- Set up **monthly sales reviews** to track tren
