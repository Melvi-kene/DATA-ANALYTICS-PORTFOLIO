**Performance Highlights:**  
- Main dishes generate the most revenue, led by Pasta Alfredo and Grilled Chicken  
- Loyal customers like `CUST_089` contribute significantly to repeat orders  
- Peak sales in **Oct 2022** and **May 2023** indicate seasonal opportunities  
- Cash & credit cards are the most preferred payment methods  

**Performance Gaps:**  
- Total sales declined in 2023 compared to 2022  
- February recorded the lowest sales in both years  
- December underperformed despite being a holiday month  
- Digital wallet usage remains low compared to other payment options  

**Strategic Recommendations:**  
- Launch festive campaigns and targeted promotions in December and February  
- Implement a loyalty or referral program to retain and attract customers  
- Introduce new variations of best-selling main dishes  
- Consider bundling items (e.g., main + starter) to increase order value  
- Encourage digital wallet use with small discounts or reward incentives  
- Investigate causes of 2023 sales drop, consider customer feedback or external factors  
- Set up monthly sales review to track trends and act on early performance dips
